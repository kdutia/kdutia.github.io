hello! I'm head of data science at nonprofit [Climate Policy Radar](https://climatepolicyradar.org/) where we're building free tools which use NLP to improve climate decision-making from documents.

my work is broadly centered on NLP, climate change and how to do the former responsibly and collaboratively in the context of the latter. this includes:

**building things**, such as

- collaborative research, on
  - [responsible RAG for climate decision-making from documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23902)
  - [identifying climate targets in national laws and policies using machine learning](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/iclr2024/26) (ICLR 2024)
- a technical analysis tool [for the First Global Stocktake](https://gst1.org/), partnered with the UNFCCC
- parts of each iteration of our [climate policy (re)search tool](https://app.climatepolicyradar.org)

**supporting the broader community** through organising events and online spaces, and doing talks

- I co-organised both the [first](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2024.climatenlp-1/) and [second](https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2025.climatenlp-1/) workshops at ACL (2024-5)
- I co-founded an [online community for people working on Climate NLP](https://climatenlpcommunity.github.io/), with an active Slack and monthly talks
- I've given talks on
  - [impact, equity and community in our data science](/talks/2024_CPR_at_Nesta_data_science_away_day.pdf) at Nesta (2024)
  - [a policy evidence base as a knowledge graph](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MbYrCa1fhcU7v1X-gLh2sxWonxJpw9uZ5Eiy7qLbRt8/edit#slide=id.g104591c5ed4_0_0) at the Turing Institute (2023)
- I'm sometimes (rarely) on panels, like
  - Matchmaking for Climate Policy, Information and Finance AI Solutions at [Bonn AI and Climate Expert Meeting](https://unu.edu/conference/bonn-ai-climate-2024) (2024)

before Climate Policy Radar I was lead developer on the [Heritage Connector](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/projects/heritage-connector) project, which built a system for building knowledge graphs from museum collections using NLP and Wikidata. we wrote a [peer-reviewed paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/ail2.23), maintained [a blog](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritageconnector/), and showed off some of our demos in a [final talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVV08dun_jY&list=PLRIxrpy54RHbqCRlYysM9vX_LStbDJ3Ov&index=2).
